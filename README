NAME
    OpenGL::RWX - Provides support for loading 3D models from RWX files

SYNOPSIS
      # Create the object but don't load anything
      my $model = OpenGL::RWX->new(
          file => 'mymodel.rwx',
      );
      
  # Load the model into OpenGL
      $model->init;
      
  # Render the model into the current scene
      $model->display;

DESCRIPTION
    OpenGL::RWX provides a basic implementation of a RWX file parser.

    Given a file name, it will load the file and parse the contents directly
    into a compiled OpenGL display list.

    The OpenGL display list can then be executed directly from the RWX
    object.

    The current implementation is extremely preliminary and functionality
    will be gradually fleshed out over time.

    In this initial test implementation, the model will only render as a set
    of points in space using the pre-existing material settings.
